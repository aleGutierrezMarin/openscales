OpenScales

	{{{http://openscales.org/}OpenScales}} is an open source ({{{http://openscales.org/license.html}LGPL}}) mapping framework written in ActionScript 3 and Flex that allows developers to building Rich Internet Mapping Applications. Designed for interoperability, it supports data from any major spatial open standards protocols such as OGC protocols and formats.

	Being a community-driven project, OpenScales is developed, tested, and supported by a diverse group of individuals from around the world.

	Openscales is already used in {{{http://bitbucket.org/gis/openscales/wiki/They_use_OpenScales}various projects}}.
	
	Last stable release is <<OpenScales 1.1.8>>.

	This documentation is the <<OpenScales 1.1.8 user guide>>. It has been created to help you to build OpenScales based applications.

	OpenScales has been initially started from {{{http://code.google.com/p/flexlayers/}FlexLayers}} source code, donated by Scott Pezanowski. FlexLayers was a Flex port of {{{http://openlayers.org/}OpenLayers}}. Since the beginning, the codebase has been extensively modified and improved. Nevertheless, even if OpenScales API is not strictly equivalent to OpenLayers one, if you have ever developed on OpenLayers, you will find OpenScales API quite easy to understand.
